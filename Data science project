Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

>> 	Select * from tablename;
	
i. 	  Attribute  	= 10000
ii. 	Business  	= 10000
iii.	Category  	= 10000
iv. 	Checkin  		= 10000
v. 	  elite_years = 10000
vi. 	friend  		= 10000
vii.  hours  		  = 10000
viii. photo  		  = 10000
ix. 	review  		= 10000
x. 	  tip 			  = 10000
xi. 	user 		  = 10000
	
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.


>> 	Select count(distinct(business_id)) from hours;


i. 	  Business 		= 10000 (id)
ii. 	Hours 		  = 1562 (business_id)
iii.	Category 	  = 2643 (business_id)
iv. 	Attribute 	= 1115 (business_id)
v. 	  Review 		  = 10000 (id) , 8090 (business_id) , 9581 (user_id) 
vi. 	Checkin 		= 493 (business_id)
vii.	Photo 		  = 10000 (id) , 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip 			  = 537 (user_id) , 3979 (business_id)
ix. 	User 		    = 10000 (id)
x. 	  Friend 		  = 11 (user_id)
xi. 	Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

>> 2-3 star ratings have more ours than the 4-5 star ratings.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
>>	Yes. In one business, 4-5 and 2-3 star ratings have almost similar reviews.
	But in another business, 4-5 ratings have way more reviews than 2-3 ratings.         

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

>>	All are from different postal code

SQL code used for analysis:

>>	select b.name, b.city, b.stars, c.category, h.hours, b.review_count, b.postal_code 
	from business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id 
	inner join hours h on b.id = h.business_id 
	where b.city = 'Las Vegas' and c.category = 'Shopping' 
	group by b.stars;
		
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		

i. Difference 1:   Number of records
				Open business = 8480
				Closed business = 1520
         
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

ii. Difference 2:	Average ratings and total reviews
				Open business avg rating / total review = 3.67/ 269300
         			Closed business avg rating / total review = 3.52/ 35261
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

>>	select count(distinct(id)), avg(stars), sum(review_count), is_open 
	from business 
	group by is_open;

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
>>	I will be figuring out the emotional side of the users by comparing the Business stars (outlet stars) 
	with the user’s review stars in order to find the general trend of the user rating vis-a-vis restaurant’s rating. 
  
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
>>	I will be needing some columns of business table like name, id and stars 
	which I will compare with the star ratings of the review table 
	I will be joining both the tables ‘business’ and ‘review with
	an INNER JOIN on business_id and review_id.
	Will group this final dataset by ‘business id.


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\	                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
